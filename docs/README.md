# Root Digger

Root digger is a program that will, given an MSA, tree, and
non-reversable model, place a root on an unrooted tree.

# Building

Root digger depends on `pll-modules`, which can be satisfied by

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Furthermore, the particular variant of `libpll` that is used by Root
digger requires The GNU Scientific Library (GSL). Most distributions
have packages available, so installing it should be done through your
package manager.

Root digger requires `cmake` to build. There is a `makefile` provieded
which will set up the build directory and build the software
automatically. Once the software is built, the binary `rd` is placed in
the `bin` directory, along with `rd_test`, which is the test suite.

# Usage

    ./rd --msa <MSA FILE> --tree <TREE FILE> --model <MODEL FILE>

The MSA file can be in any format that is supported by `libpll`, which
at the time of writing is one of: "relaxed" phylip or fasta. The tree
file should contain a metric tree in newick format. The model file
should be a comma separated list of numbers which specifies the
subsitution model. For example, if you have some DNA data, and your
substitution rate matrix looks like this:

    *, a, b, c,
    d, *, e, f,
    g, h, *, i,
    j, k, l, *,

then the file should have the contents

    a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l
