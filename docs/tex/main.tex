In phylogenetic analysis, it is common to infer trees which are unrooted. This
is to say, it is unknown which node is the most recent common ancestor of all
the taxa present in the phylogenetic tree. This information is often desirable,
as it provides a direction to the edges in the tree.  There exist several
methods to recover a root, including midpoint rooting and using a special taxon
as an outgroup. Additionally, a non-reversable Markov model can be used to
compute the likelihood of a root. In this paper, we present software which uses
a provided non-reversable model to compute the most likely root location.
