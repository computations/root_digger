Dear Editors,

Please consider the manuscript enclosed entitled: "RootDigger: a root placement
program for phylogenetic trees" for publication in *PUBLICATION* as *PAPER
TYPE*. 

RootDigger implements new approach to rooting a phylogenetic tree. While other
tools can perform the same task, namely IQ-TREE, RootDigger is substantially
faster than IQ-TREE. We found that on simulations RootDigger was regularly a
factor of approximalty 2 computationally faster than IQ-TREE. On empirical data,
the same pattern applies, with some datasets being as much as 48x faster.
