	abstract = {The field of molecular evolution has experienced explosive growth in recent years due to the rapid accumulation of genetic sequence data, continuous improvements to computer hardware and software, and the development of sophisticated analytical methods. The increasing availability of large genomic data sets requires powerful statistical methods to analyse and interpret them, generating both computational and conceptual challenges for the field. Computational Molecular Evolution provides an up-to-date and comprehensive coverage of modern statistical and computational methods used in molecular evolutionary analysis, such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. Yang describes the models, methods and algorithms that are most useful for analysing the ever-increasing supply of molecular sequence data, with a view to furthering our understanding of the evolution of genes and genomes. The book emphasizes essential concepts rather than mathematical proofs. It includes detailed derivations and implementation details, as well as numerous illustrations, worked examples, and exercises. It will be of relevance and use to students and professional researchers (both empiricists and theoreticians) in the fields of molecular phylogenetics, evolutionary biology, population genetics, mathematics, statistics and computer science. Biologists who have used phylogenetic software programs to analyze their own data will find the book particularly rewarding, although it should appeal to anyone seeking an authoritative overview of this exciting area of computational biology.},

These date estimates are based on a Bayesian analysis of ∼59.8kbp of genomic data from 13 primates and 6 mammalian outgroups, using a range of paleontologically supported calibration estimates. Results support a Cretaceous last common ancestor of extant primates (∼77mya), an Eocene divergence between platyrrhine and catarrhine primates (∼43mya), an Oligocene origin of apes and Old World monkeys (∼31mya), and an early Miocene (∼18mya) divergence of Asian and African great apes.

	abstract = {The molecular clock hypothesis1 postulates that the rate of molecular evolution is approximately constant over time. Although this hypothesis has been highly controversial in the past, it is now widely accepted2–5. The assumption of rate constancy has often been taken as a basis for reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships among organisms or genes and for dating evolutionary events2–5. Further, it has been taken as strong support for the neutral mutation hypothesis5, which postulates that the majority of molecular changes in evolution are due to neutral or nearly neutral mutations6. For these reasons, the validity of the rate constancy assumption is a vital issue in molecular evolution. Recent studies7–12 using DNA sequence data have raised serious doubts about the hypothesis. These studies provided support for the suggestion made from immunological distance and protein sequence data13,14 that a rate slowdown has occurred in hominoid evolution, and showed, in agreement with DNA hybridization studies15,16, that rates of nucleotide substitution are significantly higher in rodents than in man. Here, rates of nucleotide substitution in rodents are estimated to be 4–10 times higher than those in higher primates and 2–4 times higher than those in artiodactyls. Further, this study provides strong evidence for the hominoid slowdown hypothesis13,14 and suggests a further rate-slowdown in hominoid evolution. Our results suggest that the variation in rate among mammals is primarily due to differences in generation time8,16 rather than changes in DNA repair mechanisms9. We also propose a method for estimating the divergence times between species when the rate constancy assumption is violated.},

There is broad agreement regarding many deep animal relationships, including the monophyly of animals, Bilateria, Protostomia, Ecdysozoa, and Spiralia. This stability now allows researchers to articulate the diminishing number of remaining questions in terms of well-deﬁned alternative hypotheses. These remaining questions include relationships at the base of the animal tree, the position of Xenacoelomorpha, and the internal relationships of Spiralia. Recent progress in the ﬁeld of animal phylogeny has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of development, morphology, genomes, and other characters. A remarkable pattern emerges—there is far more homoplasy for all these characters than had previously been anticipated, even among many complex characters such as segmentation and nervous systems. The fossil record dates most deep branches of the animal tree to an evolutionary radiation in the early Cambrian with roots in the Late Neoproterozoic.},

	abstract = {After decades of molecular phylogenetic studies, the deep phylogeny of gymnosperms has not been resolved, and the phylogenetic placement of Gnetales remains one of the most controversial issues in seed plant evolution. To resolve the deep phylogeny of seed plants and to address the sources of phylogenetic conflict, we conducted a phylotranscriptomic study with a sampling of all 13 families of gymnosperms and main lineages of angiosperms. Multiple datasets containing up to 1 296 042 sites across 1308 loci were analysed, using concatenation and coalescence approaches. Our study generated a consistent and well-resolved phylogeny of seed plants, which places Gnetales as sister to Pinaceae and thus supports the Gnepine hypothesis. Cycads plus Ginkgo is sister to the remaining gymnosperms. We also found that Gnetales and angiosperms have similar molecular evolutionary rates, which are much higher than those of other gymnosperms. This implies that Gnetales and angiosperms might have experienced similar selective pressures in evolutionary histories. Convergent molecular evolution or homoplasy is partially responsible for the phylogenetic conflicts in seed plants. Our study provides a robustly reconstructed backbone phylogeny that is important for future molecular and morphological studies of seed plants, in particular gymnosperms, in the light of evolution.},

A well-resolved species phylogeny would provide an important framework to study these traits, but has not yet been achieved, in part because the few genes available in past studies gave conflicting signals. Such discordant gene trees could be the result of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) in recently diverged parts of the phylogeny, but there are indications that introgression could be a source of conflict.},

	abstract = {The problem of inferring confidence sets of gene trees is discussed without assuming that the substitution model or the branching pattern of any of the investigated trees is correct. In this case, widely used methods to compare genealogies can give highly contradicting results. Here, three methods to infer confidence sets that are robust against model misspecification are compared, including a new approach based on estimating the confidence in a specific tree using expected–likelihood weights. The power of the investigated methods is studied by analysing HIV–1 and mtDNA sequence data as well as simulated sequences. Finally, guidelines for choosing an appropriate method to compare multiple gene trees are provided.},
