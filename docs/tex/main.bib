	abstract = {The field of molecular evolution has experienced explosive growth in recent years due to the rapid accumulation of genetic sequence data, continuous improvements to computer hardware and software, and the development of sophisticated analytical methods. The increasing availability of large genomic data sets requires powerful statistical methods to analyse and interpret them, generating both computational and conceptual challenges for the field. Computational Molecular Evolution provides an up-to-date and comprehensive coverage of modern statistical and computational methods used in molecular evolutionary analysis, such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. Yang describes the models, methods and algorithms that are most useful for analysing the ever-increasing supply of molecular sequence data, with a view to furthering our understanding of the evolution of genes and genomes. The book emphasizes essential concepts rather than mathematical proofs. It includes detailed derivations and implementation details, as well as numerous illustrations, worked examples, and exercises. It will be of relevance and use to students and professional researchers (both empiricists and theoreticians) in the fields of molecular phylogenetics, evolutionary biology, population genetics, mathematics, statistics and computer science. Biologists who have used phylogenetic software programs to analyze their own data will find the book particularly rewarding, although it should appeal to anyone seeking an authoritative overview of this exciting area of computational biology.},

A computationally feasible method for finding such maximum likelihood estimates is developed, and a computer program is available. This method has advantages over the traditional parsimony algorithms, which can give misleading results if rates of evolution differ in different lineages. It also allows the testing of hypotheses about the constancy of evolutionary rates by likelihood ratio tests, and gives rough indication of the error of the estimate of the tree.},

Here, we present an estimate of the molecular divergence dates for all of the major primate groups. These date estimates are based on a Bayesian analysis of ∼59.8kbp of genomic data from 13 primates and 6 mammalian outgroups, using a range of paleontologically supported calibration estimates. Results support a Cretaceous last common ancestor of extant primates (∼77mya), an Eocene divergence between platyrrhine and catarrhine primates (∼43mya), an Oligocene origin of apes and Old World monkeys (∼31mya), and an early Miocene (∼18mya) divergence of Asian and African great apes. These dates are examined in the context of other molecular clock studies.},

	abstract = {The molecular clock hypothesis1 postulates that the rate of molecular evolution is approximately constant over time. Although this hypothesis has been highly controversial in the past, it is now widely accepted2–5. The assumption of rate constancy has often been taken as a basis for reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships among organisms or genes and for dating evolutionary events2–5. Further, it has been taken as strong support for the neutral mutation hypothesis5, which postulates that the majority of molecular changes in evolution are due to neutral or nearly neutral mutations6. For these reasons, the validity of the rate constancy assumption is a vital issue in molecular evolution. Recent studies7–12 using DNA sequence data have raised serious doubts about the hypothesis. These studies provided support for the suggestion made from immunological distance and protein sequence data13,14 that a rate slowdown has occurred in hominoid evolution, and showed, in agreement with DNA hybridization studies15,16, that rates of nucleotide substitution are significantly higher in rodents than in man. Here, rates of nucleotide substitution in rodents are estimated to be 4–10 times higher than those in higher primates and 2–4 times higher than those in artiodactyls. Further, this study provides strong evidence for the hominoid slowdown hypothesis13,14 and suggests a further rate-slowdown in hominoid evolution. Our results suggest that the variation in rate among mammals is primarily due to differences in generation time8,16 rather than changes in DNA repair mechanisms9. We also propose a method for estimating the divergence times between species when the rate constancy assumption is violated.},
